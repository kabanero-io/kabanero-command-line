	Short: "Will authenticate you to the Kabanero instance.",
	Long: `
The userid and password passed will be used
to authenticate the user with kabanero instance.

By authenticating with the Kabanero instance, 
you will be able to use the Apphub 
which provides the set of collections that your
organization has established for you to use in developing
applications.  These collections have an appsody application
stack inside them which will be used to create new
projects.  Login will also enable you to test your code
on a test integration cluster with other members of your 
team.`,
	Example: `
	kabanero login jane janespw https://kabanero1.io
	`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// loginCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// loginCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
