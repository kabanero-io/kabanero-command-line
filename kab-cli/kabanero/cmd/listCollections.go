// listCollectionsCmd represents the listCollections command
var listCollectionsCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "listCollections",
	Short: "Show the list of named collections that can be used to create applications.",
	Long: `A Kabanero collection is a governed set of meta-data
that provides pre-configured application structure, and deployment
information that allows the developer to focus on developing code. 
And once the code is stored in the source control system, the 
meta-data directs out the application to be built and deployed into
the develop downstream chain that gets it deployed into production
eventually. 

The critical piece of meta-data inside the kabanero collection is the 
Appsody stack. Appsody gives you pre-configured stacks and templates for a 
growing set of popular open source runtimes and frameworks, providing a 
foundation on which to build applications for Kubernetes and Knative deployments. 
This allows developers to focus on their code, reducing the learning curve for 
cloud-native development and enabling rapid development for these cloud-native
applications.`,
	Example: "listCollectionsCmd",
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("listCollections called")
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(listCollectionsCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// listCollectionsCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// listCollectionsCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
