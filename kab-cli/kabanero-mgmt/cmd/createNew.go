A collection is a set of meta data and base images that are used by
the developer to build a microservice or application.  This meta data includes
information about the type of application, languages, pipeline definitions,
management artifacts to install, and the base container.

In the createNew case, we provide a template for the metadata. But the 
collection provider must provide the information and containers in the 
local registry.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// createNewCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// createNewCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
