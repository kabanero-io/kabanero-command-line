A collection can be available to a development team
to use for building applications or not. Deactivate
will cause the collection to not be shown to 
the development team when they list the types of
application they can build.

This would be done in the case where you have cloned the collection
and made changes for your business.  This keeps the base collection
in the apphub, and it will continue to be updated, and the 
updates will be percolated up to your cloned collection.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// deactivateCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// deactivateCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
